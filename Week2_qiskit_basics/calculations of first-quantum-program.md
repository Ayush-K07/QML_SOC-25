#  Qiskit Circuit Analysis of My first quantum programm

This README walks through the step-by-step analysis of a 5-qubit quantum circuit and explains why the simulation output gives two results with equal probability.

##  Initial Setup

We start with all qubits in the |0‚ü© state:

All qubits: `|00000‚ü©`

##  Gate-by-Gate Quantum State Evolution

### 1Ô∏è Hadamard on Qubit 0

 œà‚ÇÅ = (1/‚àö2) √ó ( `|00000‚ü©` + `|10000‚ü©` )

---

### 2Ô∏è Pauli-X on Qubit 1

Flips q1 from |0‚ü© ‚Üí |1‚ü© in both branches:

 œà‚ÇÇ = (1/‚àö2) √ó ( `|01000‚ü©` + `|11000‚ü©` )

---

### 3Ô∏è Pauli-Z on Qubit 2

No effect since q2 = 0.

---

### 4Ô∏è Pauli-Y on Qubit 3

 œà‚ÇÉ = (i / ‚àö2) √ó ( `|01010‚ü©` + `|11010‚ü©` )

---

### 5Ô∏è CNOT (control = q1, target = q0)

Since q1 = 1 in both states, q0 flips:

 œà‚ÇÑ = (i / ‚àö2) √ó ( `|00010‚ü©` + `|10010‚ü©` )

---

### 6Ô∏è S Gate on Qubit 4

No effect since q4 = 0.

---

### 7Ô∏è Toffoli (CCX: controls = q1 & q2 ‚Üí target = q3)

q2 = 0 in both paths ‚Üí no effect.

---

### 8Ô∏è SWAP between Qubits 2 and 3

Swapping q2 and q3:

- `00010` ‚Üí `00100`
- `10010` ‚Üí `10100`

Final quantum state before measurement:

œà‚ÇÖ = (ùëñ / ‚àö2) √ó ( |00100‚ü© + |10100‚ü© )

---
##  Measurement

This final quantum state gives **equal probability** of collapsing to either `|00100‚ü©` or `|10100‚ü©`.  
Thus, in 4096 measurements (shots), we expect each state to occur approximately **2048 times**.
