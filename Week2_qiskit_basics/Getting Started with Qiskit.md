# ðŸ§ª Week 2 â€“ Getting Started with Qiskit

Welcome to **Week 2** of my quantum computing journey!  
This week focused on bridging **quantum theory** with practical coding by building quantum circuits using **Qiskit**, IBMâ€™s open-source quantum programming framework.

## ðŸ“˜ Notes â€“ Nielsen & Chuang (Ch. 4.1â€“4.4)

### 4.1 â€“ Quantum Circuit Model
- Quantum circuits are made of **quantum registers**, **classical registers**, and **gates**.
- Each gate is a **unitary transformation** on quantum state vectors.
- Measurement collapses the quantum state to a classical outcome.

### 4.2 â€“ Quantum Gates
- **Single-Qubit Gates**: H (Hadamard), X (NOT), Y, Z, S, T
- **Multi-Qubit Gates**: CNOT, SWAP, Toffoli (CCX)
- Gates are represented as matrices and act on qubits as linear transformations.

### 4.3 â€“ Circuit Diagrams
- Time flows from left to right.
- Qubits represented as horizontal wires.
- Gates are boxes or symbols (e.g. `âŠ•` for CNOT).

### 4.4 â€“ Universality
- Any quantum computation can be constructed from combinations of **single-qubit gates + CNOT**.
- These form a **universal gate set**.
