## ✅ Learning Highlights

### 🧩 1. Postulates of Quantum Mechanics
- **State Space**: Quantum states are unit vectors in a complex vector space (Hilbert space).
- **Unitary Evolution**: State evolution (without measurement) is via unitary operators.
- **Measurement**: Observable outcomes are probabilistic and cause state collapse.
- **Composite Systems**: Described using tensor products of individual subsystems.

### 🧠 2. Qubits and Superposition
- A **qubit** is a linear combination (superposition) of \(|0⟩\) and \(|1⟩\):
$$
|\psi\rangle = \alpha\,|0\rangle + \beta\,|1\rangle
$$

- Unlike classical bits, qubits can encode more information through interference and entanglement.

### 📐 3. Dirac Notation
- Introduced **bra-ket** notation:
  - Kets: \(|\psi⟩\)
  - Bras: \(\langle\psi|\)
  - Inner product: \(\langle\phi|\psi⟩\)
  - Outer product: \(|\psi⟩\langle\phi|\)

### 🔁 4. Quantum Gates and Circuits
- Gates are **unitary matrices** (reversible).
- Common gates explored:
  - **Pauli Gates**: X (NOT), Y, Z
  - **Hadamard (H)**: Creates superposition
  - **Phase gates**: S and T
  - **CNOT**: Two-qubit gate for entanglement

### 🎲 5. Measurement
- Measurement collapses a state to a computational basis state.
- Probability of outcome \( |i⟩ \): \( |\langle i | \psi \rangle|^2 \)
- Post-measurement state: The observed basis vector.
