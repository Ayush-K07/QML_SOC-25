# ðŸ§  Quantum Computing â€“ QML_SOC-25

Welcome to my repository for **QML_SOC-25**, a structured 6+ week journey through the theory and practice of **quantum computing**.  
This project combines readings from Nielsen & Chuang with hands-on implementations using **Qiskit** and real quantum hardware.
